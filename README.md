Description: Simple File Storage with Note and Password management.


1. The back-end with Spring Boot
2. The front-end with Thymeleaf
3. Application tests with Selenium

The Back-End

The back-end is all about security and connecting the front-end to database data and actions.
1. Managing User Access with Spring Security
2. Handling Front-End Calls with Controllers
3. Making Calls to the Database with MyBatis Mappers

The Front-End

Your tech lead has done a thorough job developing HTML templates for the required application pages. These templates are provided to you in the starter resources in the link above. They have included fields, modal forms, success and error message elements, as well as styling and functional components using Bootstrap as a framework. You must edit these templates and insert Thymeleaf attributes to supply the back-end data and functionality described by the following individual page requirements:
1. Login Page
2. Signup Page
3. Home Page

Testing

Your tech lead trusts you to do a good job, but testing is important whether you're an excel number-cruncher or a full-stack coding superstar! The QA team at SuperDuperDrive carries out extensive user testing. Still, your tech lead wants you to write some simple Selenium tests to verify user-facing functionality and prove that your code is feature-complete before the testers get their hands on it.
1. Write Tests for User Signup, Login, and Unauthorized Access Restrictions.
2. Write Tests for Note Creation, Viewing, Editing, and Deletion.
3. Write Tests for Credential Creation, Viewing, Editing, and Deletion.

Features/Technologies:
Java OOP, Spring Boot, MyBatis, H2 Database, Thymeleaf, Junit, Selenium
